          At www.dovileko.com, I make every effort to ensure that online gallery
          &amp; shop is as accurate and complete as possible. In order to give
          you the opportunity to view pieces in full detail, some pieces may
          appear larger or smaller than their actual size in photographs; and
          since every computer monitor is set differently, size or colour may
          vary slightly.
