          For me, working to commission is to offer clients the opportunity to
          have an input into their piece of jewellery. Essentially, the client
          likes my style of work, and there are several particular elements of
          which they would like to include in their design. It is always a
          pleasure to create the personalised piece, especially if it is a
          surprise for somebody else.

          Despite my original art jewellery pieces in wood and amber, I do
          commissions in silver and gold such as wedding rings, engagement rings
          etc.
