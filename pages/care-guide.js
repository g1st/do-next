              Store your jewellery separately, so the pieces donâ€™t rub and
              scratch against each other. It is especially important for
              oxidized silver, gold-plated metals to keep them all separated.

              Perfumes, lotions, creams and hair products can react with the
              jewellery, causing silver to tarnish and gold to erode. Apply any

              Hot weather, bright sunlight and perspiration can speed up the

              A Silver 'Dip' treatment is a great way to clean silver jewellery,
              but always make sure the jewellery is rinsed thoroughly with water

              followed.

              Always make sure earrings and brooches with amber are locked
              correctly while wearing it. Pay attention when handling these
              designs because amber could be brittle. Although it is presented
              as a gemstone that does not mean it is hard as a stone.

          Amber is authentic and organic gem material. It is still breathing and
          interacting with the environment. Amber colour may change over time,
          this is expected and contributes to the unique, intensely individual
          nature of Baltic Amber. Each piece of amber ages differently because
          of its combination of plant materials and fossil inclusions.
